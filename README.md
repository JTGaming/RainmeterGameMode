Disable Rainmeter when playing games

Rainmeter causes microstutters with hardware acceleration with each skin update. This is mostly felt and measured in games.

This app detects when a game is launched, and turns off Rainmeter.

There are two methods for this:

First one is detecting Steam games. This is automatic.

Second method is via a blacklist text file - this is manual.
If you do not use Steam, or want to exclude other programs - create a blacklist.txt file and enter the application names.
